# Model Improvements Summary

## Changes Made to Improve Generalization (Reduce Overfitting)

### 1. **Data Augmentation** ✨ (BIGGEST IMPACT)
- **What**: Added 6x data augmentation per sample
  - Original audio
  - Noise injection (±0.005)
  - Time stretch (0.9x and 1.1x speed)
  - Pitch shift (+2 and -2 semitones)
- **Why**: Creates more training variety, helps model learn robust features
- **Expected gain**: +5-10% test accuracy

### 2. **Reduced Model Complexity** 🎯
- **What**: 
  - Layer 1: 1024 → 512 neurons
  - Layer 2: 512 → 256 neurons
  - Layer 3: 256 → 128 neurons
  - Removed: Layer 4 (was 128 neurons)
- **Why**: Smaller model = less capacity to memorize, forces learning general patterns
- **Expected gain**: +3-5% test accuracy

### 3. **Increased Dropout** 💧
- **What**: 
  - Layer 1-2: 0.4 → 0.5 (25% increase)
  - Layer 3: 0.3 → 0.4 (33% increase)
- **Why**: More aggressive regularization prevents co-adaptation of neurons
- **Expected gain**: +2-4% test accuracy

### 4. **Simplified Features** 📊
- **What**: 
  - MFCC: 40 → 20 coefficients
  - Removed: Mel-spectrogram, spectral contrast
  - Stats: Removed max/min, kept mean/std
- **Why**: Less features = less noise, focuses on most important patterns
- **Expected gain**: +2-3% test accuracy

### 5. **Better Hyperparameters** ⚙️
- **What**:
  - Batch size: 64 → 32 (smaller batches = noisier gradients = better generalization)
  - Learning rate: 0.001 → 0.0005 (more stable training)
  - Weight decay: 0.01 → 0.02 (stronger L2 regularization)
  - Patience: 15 → 20 epochs (more time to converge)
  - Epochs: 150 → 200 (with early stopping)
  - Scheduler patience: 7 → 10 (less aggressive LR reduction)
- **Why**: More conservative training = better generalization
- **Expected gain**: +2-3% test accuracy

## Expected Results

### Before:
- Train Accuracy: ~67%
- Test Accuracy: ~56%
- **Gap: 11%** (significant overfitting)

### After (Expected):
- Train Accuracy: ~70-75% (may be slightly lower due to augmentation difficulty)
- Test Accuracy: **~68-75%** 🎯
- **Gap: <5%** (much better generalization)

## Key Insight

The augmentation multiplies your effective dataset size:
- Original: 1,440 samples
- With augmentation: **8,640 samples** (6x augmentation per file)
- This gives the model much more data to learn from!

## Run Command
```bash
python run_emotion.py
```

Training will take longer due to augmentation, but results should be significantly better!
